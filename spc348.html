Unlike the rest of Asia, the Okinawan staple is not rice, but the sweet potato, first introduced in the early 17th Century through trade with the Netherlands. Okinawans also eat an abundance of green and yellow vegetables &ndash; such as the bitter melon &ndash; and various soy products. Although they do eat pork, fish and other meats, these are typically a small component of their overall consumption, which is mostly plant-based foods.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe traditional Okinawan diet is therefore dense in the essential vitamins and minerals - including anti-oxidants - but also low in calories. Particularly in the past, before fast food entered the islands, the average Okinawan ate around 11% fewer calories than the normal recommended consumption for a healthy adult.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor this reason, some scientists believe that Okinawans offer more evidence for the life-enhancing virtues of a &ldquo;calorie restricted&rdquo; diet. Since the 1930s, some doctors and scientists have argued that continuously limiting the amount of energy you consume could have many benefits above and beyond weight loss &ndash; including a deceleration of the ageing process.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn one of the most compelling experiments, a group of resus macaques eating 30% fewer calories than the average monkey showed a remarkable 63% reduction in deaths from age-related diseases over a 20-year period. They also looked younger &ndash; \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.bbc.com\u002Ffuture\u002Fstory\u002F20170601-the-secret-to-a-long-and-healthy-life-eat-less\"\u003Ethey had fewer wrinkles and their fur retained its youthful lustre rather than turning grey\u003C\u002Fa\u003E. Due to practical difficulties, long-term clinical trials in humans have yet to be completed to test the effects on longevity, but a recent two-year experiment, funded by the US National Institute on Aging, was highly suggestive: \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.nia.nih.gov\u002Fhealth\u002Fcalorie-restriction-and-fasting-diets-what-do-we-know#human\"\u003Eparticipants on a calorie restricted diet showed better cardiovascular health &ndash; including lower blood pressure and cholesterol\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt&rsquo;s still not clear why a calorie restricted diet would be so beneficial, but there are many potential mechanisms.

Like calorie restriction, the low protein diets seem to promote the cell repair and maintenance. Karen Ryan, a nutritional biologist at the University of California, Davis, points out that the scarcity of amino acids can encourage cells to recycle old material (rather than synthesising new proteins).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E&ldquo;Together, these changes may prevent the ageing-associated accumulation of damaged proteins within cells,&rdquo; she says. This build-up of damaged proteins may usually be responsible for many diseases, she says &ndash; but the regular clean up when we eat a low-protein diet could prevent it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo should we all start adopting the Okinawan Diet? Not quite. Ryan points to some evidence that low protein intake may limit bodily damage up to the age of 65, but you may then benefit from increasing your protein intake after that point. &ldquo;Optimal nutrition is expected to vary across the life history,&rdquo; she says. And it&rsquo;s also worth noting one study, which found that the relative merits of protein and carbohydrates may depend on the protein's source: a diet higher in \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newscientist.com\u002Farticle\u002F2176933-eating-a-low-carb-diet-may-shorten-your-life-unless-you-go-vegan-too\u002F\"\u003Eplant-based protein appears to be better than a diet rich in meat or dairy\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, for instance. So the Okinawans may be living longer due to the fact that they are eating (mostly) fruit and vegetables, rather than its high carb, low protein content.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUltimately, the Okinawans&rsquo; health is probably due to a lucky confluence of many factors, Ryan says. &ldquo;And specific interactions among these factors will also be important.&rdquo; And we may need many more years of research to understand the importance of each of those ingredients before we finally come up with a true recipe for the &ldquo;elixir of youth&rdquo;.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EDavid Robson is a senior journalist at BBC Future.

But there is a case that the winners should consider imitating the likes of Gates (who became a philanthropist) or Warren Buffett (who argues that richer Americans should pay higher taxes) who have chosen to use their wealth and success to do good things.
